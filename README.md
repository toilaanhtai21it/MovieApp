MovieApp: App Movie Mobile Application Documentation
The Movie App is a mobile application developed using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for backend services. It allows users to explore and search for movies, view movie details, and manage their favorite movies list. With the integration of Firebase, the app supports real-time data, user authentication, and seamless cloud storage for user preferences. 
Features
  Movie Search
Users can search for movies using the Movie Database API (TMDB) or similar movie databases. The search feature provides quick access to movie titles, genres, and more.
  Movie Details Page
Each movie has a detailed page showcasing information such as the title, synopsis, release date, cast, and ratings.
  User Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used for user login and registration. Users can sign in using their email/password or social login options like Google or Facebook.
  Favorites Feature
Users can mark movies as their favorite, which is saved in Firebase Cloud Firestore. This allows them to have a personalized list of favorite movies.
  Real-time Updates
Firebase Cloud Firestore provides real-time synchronization of user data across all devices. Any changes made to the favorites list are immediately reflected on all devices.
  Cloud Storage
Firebase Storage can be used to manage images or other media related to movie details.
  Cross-Platform Support
Developed using Flutter, the app works seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Android and iOS, with a single codebase.
 Technology Stack
  Flutter
A powerful UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
  Firebase
Firebase Authentication: To handle user login and registration.
Cloud Firestore: For real-time NoSQL database to store and sync user data like favorites.
Firebase Cloud Messaging: To send push notifications to users.
Firebase Storage: For cloud storage of images, movie posters, etc.
  API Integration
TMDB API (or other movie APIs) for fetching movie data, including titles, posters, ratings, and more.
App Architecture:
State Management: The app uses a state management solution like Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc to manage the app’s state effectively.
UI/UX: The UI is built using Flutter's widget system, providing a beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly experience on Android devices.
Backend: Firebase services handle authentication, real-time data syncing, and cloud storage, offering a scalable and secure solution.
Installation & Setup:
Clone the project repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieApp_Flutter.git
Install dependencies:
flutter pub get
Set up Firebase for your project:
Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
Add your Android app to Firebase and download the google-services.json file.
Configure Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) as needed.
Run the app:
flutter run

Backend Setup (Firebase):
Create a Firebase Project:
Visit the Firebase Console.
Click Create a Project and follow the instructions.
Add Firebase to Your Android App:
Go to your Firebase project settings.
Add your Android app (you will need your app's package name).
Download the google-services.json file and place it in the android/app/ directory of your Flutter project.
Enable Firebase Services:
Authentication: Enable Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google login).
Firestore: Set up Firestore database to store user favorites and other data.
Firebase Storage: Set up Cloud Storage if you plan to store images or other media.
Cloud Messaging: Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
Configure Firebase SDK:
Add the Firebase SDK to your Flutter project. Update pubspec.yaml to include dependencies like:
flutter_stripe: ^11.2.0 
 firebase_auth: ^5.3.3
cloud_firestore: ^5.5.0
firebase_storage: ^12.3.6
Initialize Firebase in your Flutter app:
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
  SharedPreferences sp = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  Stripe.publishableKey =
      'pk_test_51QM8IxRwwGPjVJO2K9f2KjUZlMs6K91eJnQVcQ1bsGI9MPEspz6ouWEmObOxtlvCFp3CdDldwnOndQfYIqdHkzBe00qYbZNQPI';
  String imagepath = sp.getString('imagepath') ?? '';
  runApp(MyApp(
    imagepath: imagepath,
  ));

Starting the Frontend (Flutter App):
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieApp_Flutter.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and run:
flutter pub get
Set up Firebase: Follow the Backend Setup steps above to configure Firebase for the app.
Run the App: Connect an Android device or emulator, and run:
flutter run
The app should launch on your connected device.

Starting the Backend (Firebase):
Since Firebase is a serverless backend, there’s no traditional server setup. The backend is automatically managed by Firebase services. However, you should ensure that:
Firebase Authentication is enabled for email/password or social login methods.
Firestore Database is configured to store user preferences and movie data.
Push Notifications are enabled for Cloud Messaging.

TMDB API Documentation:
The TMDB (The Movie Database) API provides access to a vast collection of movie-related data. You will need an API key from TMDB to fetch movie information.
Sign Up for TMDB:
Go to TMDB.
Sign up and generate an API key from the API section.
Use the TMDB API: The API endpoints allow you to fetch data about movies, TV shows, actors, and more. Some common endpoints include:
Search Movies:
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&query=movie_name
Get Movie Details:
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
Get Popular Movies:
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
API Response:
The API returns data in JSON format. Here’s an example response for a movie search:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Inception",
      "overview": "A thief who steals corporate secrets...",
      "poster_path": "/q2TgkP9nF5dbtGz5zqDh2rH6jy6.jpg",
      "release_date": "2010-07-16"
    }
  ]
}
API Rate Limiting: TMDB API has rate limits, so you should handle requests carefully to avoid hitting the limit.
